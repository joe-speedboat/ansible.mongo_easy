joe-speedboat.mongo_easy
=========

Wrapper role for configuring mongodb nodes with the undergreen.mongodb role.
The basic idea is to have a "as simple as possible" role that achieves the following goals:

* compatibility with elastic.elasticsearch without customizing it
* inventory of multiple hosts will form a working cluster 
* single node inventory will form a secured single node
* add and/or reconfigure nodes within a cluster
* automatic bootstrapping of a new cluster
* basic best practice implemented
* more to follow...

This role follows the principal of unix/linux that says one tool is doing one thing, 
but this single thing, it does in a simple and clean way.
Altought I tried to achieve the target, your feedback by pull requests and issue requests are highly welcome.
Since elasticsearch is still a complex thing, do not expect to get free consulting here ...
But for good money, we do good consulting as well :-)

Cheers
Chris

# check the status on the master nodes as you need (with 100s of terminals, this looks pretty nerdy ðŸ¦–)
```
mongo
  use admin
    db.auth('siteRootAdmin','.Change.Me.123')
    rs.status()
    db.admin.insert({"name":"bitbull test data"})
